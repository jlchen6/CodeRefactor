Code Refactoring
*************************************
Worked with an existing webpage's html and css files and edited content to make the code better fit readability standards.

The HTML file displays a promotional website for the company Horiseon.
The site has a header, a navigation bar, a couple content sections, and a footer

The CSS file contains the formatting for the webpage and tags are organized in the order that their respective elements appear in the HTML file.
